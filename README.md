# Dyna-Mark App
### Creators:

Dyna-Mark is an app that was created to help dynamically bookmark essential websites to help you become a better programmer. Everyone has needed or wanted the best references to go to when learning how to code, this app will provide users with the ability to find bookmarks that have been added by key word searches like 'javascript, 'html', 'css' and so much more! Here users will also be able to add bookmarks of their own to the website, so it too becomes discoverable and can be viewed by those who can benefit from it!

### Vercel:
We used Vercel to deploy the front-end of the Dyna-Mark app, Vercel is a simple way to deploy your site! It is free and allows you to connect to your GitHub so you are then able to directly link your Github repos. After they are linked Vercel takes it from there and deploys your website!

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repository in any folder you feel works best

## MVP
- As a user, I want to be able to add bookmarks to useful coding websites
- As A User, I want to be able to add useful coding websites
- As a user I want to be able to see description of these websites
- As a user, I want to be able to see tags associated with the website to help find what I am looking for
- As a user, I want to be able to like or dislike a website

## Post MVP Example
- Made it so the tags on the bookmarks could be color coded, to be able to clearly distinguish how many tags there are on a bookmark
- Included direct links to our LinkedIns and GitHubs
- Added a dark mode, to switch from light mode

## What to add in the future...
- Add user authentication 
- Where users can login and view their own bookmarks or add bookmarks to their account to refer to
- Display all the most liked references so that is what users can see first, and hopefully find the most helpful resource
- Adding a comment section for the bookmarks
- Add a video preview to the bookmarks so users can see what to expect before clicking on the link!

## Project management
Our team got together to have standups and standowns for about 2-5 minutes at the beginning and end of each day. This helped set us up to know what we need to get down and appreciate what has been done! We followed a typical Git Flow to ensure no merge conflicts occur when commiting for this project. This also entailed setting up different working branches to insure we would not be working on the same component or affecting anyone else's work! We collaborated accordingly and made sure everyone had enough to do, or got the support that was needed to move forward in a timely manner.

## Issues and Resolutions
- We came across an issue with our Discover component where the page would try to load before the API could grab the data. To resolve this we changed how we filter the data and added a handle
- When trying to work with dark mode it messed with our CSS, but we peer programmed to get this sorted out and styled properly!
